# Fields
The Flow Analyzer supports a number of fields, which are used by many vendors and platforms. We've made an effort to
analyze and include the most common fields, though there are certain to be fields in use we haven't seen yet.

The default fields are created in the Elasticsearch Flow index by the [build_index.sh script](../Install/build_index.sh) that
is called by the [ubuntu_install.sh installation script](../Install/ubuntu_install.sh). You don't have to create these fields
manually unless you're using your own Elasticsearch cluster.

Here are the commonly used fields supported out-of-the-box for each respective protocol:

# Netflow v5

# IPFIX (aka Netflow v10)
**Field table documentation in progress**

Flows exported by IPFIX are based on templates, and include templates specified in the Netflow v9 standard for backward compatibility. Flows may or may not include the following fields depending on the vendor and configured templates:

Field                     | Description   | Measurement Units     | Supported     | Notes |
---                       | ---           | ---                   | ---           | ---   |

<sup>1</sup> Mikrotik - Exported by Mikrotik as "0", not supported by RouterOS as of November 2016.

<sup>2</sup> Local to the individual collector device, must be combined with the device's IP address or another unique identifier.
